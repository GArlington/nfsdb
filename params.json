{"name":"NFSdb","tagline":"Need-For-Speed Db. Low-latency, in-process database","body":"NFSdb\r\n======\r\n\r\nNFSdb is a low latency, high throughput time-series database written entirely in Java. The goal of the project is a study of what's possible to do in java with large datasets. And we would like to share benefits of this study with everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Maven\r\n\r\nNFSdb requires minimum of Java 7 and stable release is available from maven Central:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.nfsdb</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>nfsdb-core</artifactId>\r\n            <version>1.0.1</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nTo help you getting started we have created code examples in [nfsdb-samples] (https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/tree/master/nfsdb-samples) repository.\r\n\r\nAlternatively there is quick start guide on github [wiki] (https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nOn test rig (Intel i7-920 @ 4Ghz) NFSdb shows average read latency of 20-30ns and write latency of 60ns per column of data. Read and write do not have any GC overhead.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNFSdb is available under [Apache 2.0 License] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nNFSdb project is being actively developed and supported. You can raise and [Issue] (https://github.com/bluestreak01/nfsdb/issues) on github or join our [google group] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nfsdb)\r\n\r\nOur project web site [www.nfsdb.org] (http://nfsdb.org) is coming soon!\r\n\r\n12 May 2014.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
