{"name":"NFSdb","tagline":"Need-For-Speed Db. Low-latency, in-process database","body":"NFSdb (www.nfsdb.org) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/NFSdb/nfsdb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/NFSdb/nfsdb)\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nNFSdb is a low latency, high throughput time-series database written entirely in Java. We use memory-mapped files to bring you fully persisted database with performance characteristics of in-memory cache.\r\nThe goal of this project is to make the fastest and most developer friendly database in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Maven\r\n\r\nNFSdb requires minimum of Java 7 and stable release is available from maven Central:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.nfsdb</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>nfsdb-core</artifactId>\r\n            <version>1.0.3</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nCheck out our [Quick-Start Guide] (http://www.nfsdb.org/quick-start/)\r\n\r\nWe also have a growing collection of examples:\r\n \r\n[nfsdb-samples] (https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/tree/master/nfsdb-samples) repository.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nOn test rig (Intel i7-920 @ 4Ghz) NFSdb shows average read latency of 20-30ns and write latency of 60ns per column of data. Read and write do not have any GC overhead.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNFSdb is available under [Apache 2.0 License] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nNFSdb project is being actively developed and supported.
