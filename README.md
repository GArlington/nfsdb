## News
__9 June 2015__   Release roadmap

I realise that it has been a while since last release, but I would like to reassure the reader that this project is very much alive. The [roadmap for next](roadmap.md) release is quite large but we are chipping away from this list quite steadily. So stay with us!

__22 Jan 2015__.  3.0.0-SNAPSHOT is available for testing.

There is a number of exciting features planned for 3.0 release. Although main focus is on super-fast, functional query language and data accessibility, we have some interesting features ready to go:

- generic data access; for on-the-fly data definition and non-ORM data access
- write cluster and automatic failover for data producers

__14 Oct 2014__.  [Release 2.1.0](http://github.nfsdb.org/release-notes/) - stable

This is security-centric release aimed at having replication meet security standards. Features supported in this release are: SSL, Certificate auth (Mutual-auth), Shared Key Auth, Kerberso Auth, Kerberos SSO Auth (Windows only) and client auto-reconnect.
